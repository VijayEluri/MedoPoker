MedoPoker

J2ME game of poker, using bluetooth to connect up to 4 players.

If you make any changes or improvements, please contact me (just curious).

AnalyzerTest class needs SpecialK library (https://github.com/SpecialK/SpecialKEval). You can probably just delete src/medopoker/logic/AnalyzerTest.java to just compile and run the game.
